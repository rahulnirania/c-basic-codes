I am a student of IIT Jammu currently studying in 2nd semester. I have applied for education loan in november in SBI mohalla Janipur Jammu(J&K). The bank offcials assured me that I will receive a file at my home for some formalities. I stayed at my home for 2.5 months but nobody contacted me. After my vacations when I visted the bank, they asked me to apply again. I prepared the file again and submitted in the bank. Later whenever I visted bank, they kept on avoiding me. After 3 months I got to know that process of my loan has not even started. Now after 5.5 months I have still not seen any progress. I am completely harassed now and will not be able to pay fees of 3rd semester myself if loan will not be passed. Looking for a quick reply from your side.
